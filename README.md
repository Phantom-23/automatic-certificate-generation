# Automated Certificate Generator & Emailer

## Usage instructions:

> üìù **NOTE:** Please follow the below instructions properly to avoid any errors.

- Install the necessary Python packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` command in the command line, in the root directory. Use Python version 3 or greater else you need to run `pip install json smtplib ssl email` also.

- In the root directory, create a `.env` file and add the following environment variables, which are needed for sending emails.
```
email="USE_YOUR_EMAIL_FOR_TESTING"
email_app_password="USE_APP_PASSWORD"
email_host="smtp.gmail.com"
email_port="465"
```
In the above environment variables, make sure you replace values of `email` and `email_app_password`.

- Inside the `data` folder, make sure to keep the following 2 files:
  - Participant's excel sheet (make sure it has a `.xlsx` or `.xls` extension).
  - Certificate template (make sure it has a `.png` extension).

- In `data/input_data.json` file, mandatorily fill in the following with the correct details:
```json
{
    "participants_excel_file_name": "FILE_NAME_WITH_EXTENSION",
    "email_subject": "EMAIL_SUBJECT_GOES_HERE",
    "email_body": "EMAIL_BODY_GOES_HERE",
    "certificate_template_filename": "TEMPLATE_FILE_NAME_WITH_PNG_EXT",
    "img_link":"LINK_TO_IMAGE_IN_EMAIL",
    "print_date": false
}
```
For the email body, seperate new lines with a `<br/>`. Note that in the `participants_excel_file_name` field, the filename should be the one present inside `data` folder and only specify the file name with extension, not the file path. Similar rule applies for `certificate_template_filename` field.

- The participants excel file must have atleast `Name` and `Email` columns. Note that these column names are *case-sensitive*.

## Generating Certificates & Sending Emails:

- Run `main_script.py` file using the following command in the command line at the root directory: `python main_script.py`.

- A window with the certificate template will appear, do the following:
  - Double click for the first time. The place where you double clicked will indicate the **top left corner** for the NAME on the certificate.
  - Double click for the second time, if you want to print date on certificate. The place where you double clicked will indicate the **top left corner** for the DATE on the certificate.
  - Now, hit `ENTER`.

- The script will then generate the certificates and send emails. For the first generated certificate, a new window will open to show that. Make sure you close it to continue generating the remaining certificates.

- Open the excel sheet and you will now see two new columns: `Email Sent` and `Remarks`. To run the script again with the same excel sheet, delete these columns and follow the same above steps. If `Email Sent` column is present and is set to `Yes`, email wont be sent to that mail id. Also, make sure to delete the `certificates` folder while re-running to avoid any naming conflicts.

- Before running the main script, **make sure the excel sheet is not open in your system**.
